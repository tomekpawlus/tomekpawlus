- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tomek

Currently I'am learning programming and some time in the future I'd like to find oportunity for internship in IT.

Until now I'm mainly focusing on building backend application with using of:

-Java
-Spring Boot, MVC, REST API
-JDBC/JPA/Hibernate/SQL & relational databases(MySQL)

But also I put some effort to learn some frontend technologies like: JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Angular
